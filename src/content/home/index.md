Hey! I’m **Wilson Angelie Tan**, a Computer Science student at **Universitas Padjadjaran (UNPAD)** with a strong interest in **Software Engineering and System Design**.

I enjoy turning ideas into practical systems, especially tools that improve productivity, learning, or decision-making. My focus is on building things that are understandable, maintainable, and useful.

## What I Do

- **Software Development**  
  Web applications, backend systems, and clean application architecture.

- **AI & Systems Exploration**  
  Learning and experimenting with AI-driven evaluation, automation, and data-driven features.

- **Open Learning**  
  I document what I learn through projects, experiments, and technical notes.

## Current Interests

- System design and software architecture
- Engineering best practices and maintainable codebases
- Cloud infrastructure, primarily AWS, for scalable and reliable systems
- Open source projects
- Building tools and utilities that help myself and others

## Projects

You can find my projects here:

→ **[Projects Page](/projects)**

(Some projects are experimental and continuously evolving.)

## Writing & Sharing

Occasionally, I write short technical notes, project breakdowns, or reflections on what I’m learning—primarily focused on software engineering fundamentals.

## Outside of Coding

Outside of programming, I enjoy:
- Learning new systems and tools
- Exploring ideas around technology and education
- Working on side projects that combine logic and creativity
